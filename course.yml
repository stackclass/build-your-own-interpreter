  This challenge follows the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.

  In this challenge you'll build an interpreter for [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html), a simple scripting
  language. Along the way, you'll learn about tokenization, ASTs, tree-walk interpreters and more.

  Before starting this challenge, make sure you've read the "Welcome" part of the book that contains these chapters:

  - [Introduction](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html) (chapter 1)
  - [A Map of the Territory](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-map-of-the-territory.html) (chapter 2)
  - [The Lox Language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) (chapter 3)

  These chapters don't involve writing code, so they won't be covered in this challenge. This challenge will start
  from chapter 4, [Scanning](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html).

summary: |-
  Learn about tokenization, ASTs, tree-walk interpreters and more.
